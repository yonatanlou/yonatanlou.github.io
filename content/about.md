# About me

I’m Yonatan, an AI Researcher at <a href="https://www.tavily.com/">Tavily</a>, working on building the best web infrastructure layer for agents.
I hold a Master’s degree in Statistics and Data Science from Tel Aviv University, where I conducted research under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~roded/">Roded Sharan</a> and <a href="https://english.tau.ac.il/profile/028799815/">Jonathan Ben-Dov</a>, applying NLP and Graph Neural Network methods to identify the authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls (<a href="https://github.com/yonatanlou/QumranNLP">QumranNLP</a>).

Before joining Tavily, I worked as a researcher at <a href="https://www.forter.com/">Forter</a>, doing applied machine learning for fraud detection at scale, leveraging both classical methods and DL.
