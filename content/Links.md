Feels like the internet made humanity a bit too similar, probably thanks to Google’s PageRank algorithm, SEO hacks, GenAI’s crappy content, and so on...
In these GenAI days, I find it super important to keep reading quality content.
My way of doing that is by following the right people on Twitter, subscribing to RSS feeds of blogs I admire, reading books, listening to podcasts, and more.
I’ll try to update here with the stuff I liked most.

- Books on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/103722180-yonatan-lourie)
- Movies, TV shows on [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur88119677/ratings/)
- Music on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/224udkuetwxsiqba7n4tums6q?si=_RD2kBO8QlSUYLfjBLjBEQ&nd=1)

A lot of friends ask me for podcast recommendations. The truth is, while there are tons of great episodes out there, only about 10% are really (but really) good. Here are the episodes that, in my opinion, were really, really good:

And this is a list of the podcasts I listen to occasionally:

Things that i bought and i think that are worth the money:
- [NEBULA Capsule 3](https://amzn.to/3CSE32p) - Portable projector, in heavy use, great quality.
- [DEWALT 20V MAX XR Hammer Drill Kit](https://amzn.to/4gKbstO) - The best hammer drill i ever had.
- [Amazon Kindle (16 GB)](https://amzn.to/4i0BwlB) - I read a lot because of this (specially while traveling).
- [Philips Norelco Multigroom 7000](https://amzn.to/42XV1qT) - Very good, for more than 4 years now.
