## Podcasts
A lot of friends ask me for podcast recommendations. The truth is, while there are tons of great episodes out there, only about 10% are really (but really) good. Here are the episodes that, in my opinion, were really, really good:

And this is a list of the podcasts I listen to occasionally:

## Other Things
For years, I tried to organize my favorite movies, books, and other things I liked into a single database like Notion or Obsidian. It eventually became a huge time-consuming burden, so I decided to simplify things:

- Books on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/103722180-yonatan-lourie)
- TV shows on [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur88119677/ratings/)
- Music on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/224udkuetwxsiqba7n4tums6q?si=_RD2kBO8QlSUYLfjBLjBEQ&nd=1)

In the last 20 years, i feel like the internet made the humanity too similar (for example, an interesting about the diversity of our opinions as society - [Comparing the diversity of information by word-of-mouth vs.
web spread](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.01378)).
That's probably due to the PageRank algorithm of google, SEO stuff, GenAI shitty content, etc...
The current best solution is to use diverse search engine (an [awesome article](https://vickiboykis.com/2024/04/25/how-i-search-in-2024/) by Vicki Boykis), or to follow the right people in twitter, but for myself, im saving the best content that ive encounter in [Links](/quality-content). -->
